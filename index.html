                <p>Infinio Systems is out to build a revolutionary product in the infrastructure storage market.  Its a product that prioritizes ease of use, low barrier to entry, and turns a complicated technology into a lightweight platform.  My work on this project include every element of the design process from user research and conception to visual design and implmenetation.</p>

                <h6>Goal</h6>
                <p>The goal of the user interface for the Infinio Accelerator was to give customers a no-nonsense method of installation and a clear way to understand performance results.  Now, the technology itself is a server-side cache - it improves the performance of servers.  The interesting question is how do customers want to utilize this new technology?</p> 

                <h6>Approach</h6>
                <p>From the beginning, the Infinio team has taken a user-centered approach to drive requirements and interface design.  We started out by interviewing a variety of people in the IT space to gain a greater understanding of their performance issues and the context they work in.  This helped us understand the manner at which our product is installed, how customers want to understand system performance, and concerns they hold if issues were to arise.  Gaining an intimate understanding of the admin’s needs gave us confidence to put together a product experience that just made sense to people.</p>  

                <h6>Result</h6>
                <p>The product experience starts off with a self-guided installation wizard.  Based on the information collected here, the customer experience utilizing the core functionality of the product is as seamless as possible.</p>

                <p class="caption">Installation Wizard</p>
                <p>As the product matured from its first to second version, our goals did not change, but the tactics we used to meet the goals needed improvement.  Before launching the initial version of the product, we made sure the product’s UI was usable and simple, but we learned a lot about how it was actually used and what was truly important once it went to market.</p>  

                <p>The second version of the product has a much clearer focus on telling the user important details such as status and performance...</p>
